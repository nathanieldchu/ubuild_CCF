    content: "<strong>Give a shit</strong>. Care about what you do, care about how
      you do it, care about the people you do it with, and care about the planet and
      everything else that brought you here in the first place.<br><br><strong>Think
      on evolutionary timescales</strong>. Most bad things result from short-term
      thinking. Climate change, war, all-you-can-eat Indian buffet. But life is a
      long-term game, so be honest, be humble, and don’t be an asshole.<br><br><strong>Stay
      hungry</strong>. Always seek discomfort and growth. To make a future world better
      than the present, make your present self better than your past. Don’t compare
      yourself with others but with who you were yesterday.<br><br><strong>Make meaning
      through others</strong>. Look, we all fantasize about abandoning the world for
      a hut in the woods. But in life, the most meaningful things are experienced
      with others, and the biggest problems aren’t solved alone. Trust others, and
      they will trust you; understand others, and you will understand yourself; work
      with others on big problems, and wake up with a purpose.<br><br><strong>Savor
      every bite.</strong> Have fun and take care of yourself. Sometimes even the
      end of civilization isn’t that serious. You have one life; bask in it."
