    content: "<strong>Give a shit</strong>. Care about what you do, care about how
      you do it, care about the people you do it with, and care about the planet and
      everything else that brought you here in the first place.<br><br><strong>Log
      growth.</strong> To make a future world better than the present, make your present
      self better than your past. Challenge yourself to change. Invest in the person
      you want remembered. Don’t compare yourself with others, but with who you were
      yesterday.<br><br><strong>Empower others</strong>. Seek your success by helping
      others achieve theirs. On your deathbed, what will you remember: learning to
      ride a bike or teaching your kid to ride a bike? By helping others, you achieve
      missions greater than yourself and feel the joy of being proud instead of pompous.<br><br><strong>Treat
      feedback as a gift</strong>. Ideas, critiques, questions, and feelings are the
      most valuable things you will ever give or get. Give them thoughtfully and receive
      them gratefully.<br><br><strong>Savor every bite</strong>. Have fun and take
      care of yourself. You have one life; bask in it."
