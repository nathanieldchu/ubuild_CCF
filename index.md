  headline: building a more <strong>sustainable</strong> world
  content: Inspired by the natural world and driven to protect it, we set out to change
    food for the better. We work to save the world by making <strong>big flavors with
    tiny footprints</strong>. We're a public benefit company, which means we baked
    this mission into our company DNA (we're also nerds, which is why we say things
    like DNA).<br><br><strong>Sustainability shouldn't have to taste like broccoli</strong>
    (but, for the record, we really like broccoli).
