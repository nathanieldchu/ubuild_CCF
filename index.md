  headline: Our take on greenwashing
  content: "<p>Two crises threaten our existence—<strong>mass extinction and climate
    change</strong>. Global food and agriculture is the largest contributor to shrinking
    natural habitats and rising atmospheric carbon. We love existence. So to help
    preserve it, our mission is not to build a unicorn, give rich people nice things,
    or create tech for tech’s sake. We are building this public benefit company to
    create <strong>delicious, cheap, and nutritions foods that change how the 99%
    eat</strong>.</p><p>Or at least we’ll make nachos.</p>"
