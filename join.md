  headline: About us
  content: "<p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to excite people about eating sustainably
    by crafting cultured foods that tap into the diversity of the microbial world.
    Instead of handing out lectures or guilt trips, we want to create a world where
    food tastes fantastic, is affordable and accessible, and happens to be made from
    the most sustainable ingredients around.</p><p><strong>Our core values</strong>
    are:</p><p><strong>Give a shit</strong>. Care about what you do, care about how
    you do it, care about the people you do it with, and care about the planet and
    everything else that brought you here in the first place.</p><p><strong>Log growth</strong>.
    To make a future world better than the present, make your present self better
    than your past. Challenge yourself to change. Invest in the person you want remembered.
    Don’t compare yourself with others, but with who you were yesterday.</p><p><strong>Empower
    others</strong>. Seek your success by helping others achieve theirs. On your deathbed,
    what will you remember: learning to ride a bike or teaching your kid to ride a
    bike? By helping others, you achieve missions greater than yourself and feel the
    joy of being proud instead of pompous.</p><p><strong>Treat feedback as a gift</strong>.
    Ideas, critiques, questions, and feelings are the most valuable things you will
    ever give or get. Give them thoughtfully, and receive them gratefully.</p><p><strong>Savor
    every bite</strong>. Have fun and take care of yourself. You have one life; bask
    in it.</p>"

  headline: Team support
  content: "<p>You can't help others unless you have enough in the tank. You can't
    face your fears if you feel constantly insecure. We are always looking for ways
    to build a supportive community so that each member can take on challenges, demons,
    and missions with chutzpah. As part of this community, we work to provide security
    in the following areas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Financial health</strong>: competitive
    salaries, retirement plans, transparent and progressive pay structures, profit
    sharing, equity ownership</p></li><li><p><strong>Physical health</strong>: strong
    health insurance, active community, proximity to Berkeley Bowl produce</p></li><li><p><strong>Mental
    health</strong>: minimum and mandatory 3 weeks paid time off with bullshit-free
    support for taking more when you need it</p></li><li><p><strong>Social health</strong>:
    parental leave, communal lunch not at your desk</p></li><li><p><strong>Spiritual
    health</strong>: regular meetings to exchange feedback and ensure that you are
    asking the hard questions and we are supporting you to pursue your truest self,
    dark chocolate</p></li></ul>"
