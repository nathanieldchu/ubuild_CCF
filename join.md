  headline: About us
  content: '<p>First take a thoughtful look at our <a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/values"
    title="">mission and values</a>. Are you fired up? You can find our open positions
    below, but but before that it might be useful to ask yourself a few questions
    to see whether you are a good cultural fit.</p><h4>Do you love the steep end of
    the learning curve?</h4><p>What sounds like more fun:</p><p><strong>Being the
    expert</strong> in something and a company’s go-to resource for that thing. You
    crush it all day long.</p><p><strong>Constantly building</strong> by scheming
    up new ideas, getting totally lost, reading 100 Wikipedia articles that you never
    would have guessed existed, figuring out how to turn your idea into reality, making
    a first version from scratch and duct tape, building another that totally kicks
    ass and shoving it out into the world, and then repeating all of it.</p><p>If
    the second one sounds like your jam, then we might be a good fit. We put equal
    value on expertise and open-minded ignorance. We love learning new topics, building
    new systems, and making real stuff. We may reach a time when we need experts to
    focus on one thing. But right now we seek stubborn optimists who won’t stop until
    the dream in their head lands in their hands. Few things are as exciting to us
    as doing something scary and new. Speaking of scary:</p><p></p><h4>Do you love
    type II fun?</h4><p>In mountaineering, there are three types of fun:</p><p><strong>Type
    I Fun</strong>—also known as “fun” by normal people—is activities that are fun
    in the moment. Eating at your favorite restaurant. Seeing a surprise hit movie
    with your friends. Reading Harry Potter. Outdoor activities with great conditions
    (no bugs, deep powder) and mild objectives (alpine lake swimming, climbing hand
    cracks, fishing).</p><p><strong>Type II Fun</strong> sucks in the moment. It is
    painful, you are hungry and tired, and you were not prepared. You might die. Shit,
    are we going to die? But somehow you make it out, and in the rosy glow of hindsight
    you declare, “Wow, what a great experience! I learned so much about myself and
    the world! We did it!” Overzealous alpine objectives, your first breakup, having
    children. In its highest form, type II fun is when you feel in your heart like
    everything is going to implode (imposter syndrome, social rejection, pushing yourself
    past the limit), but you know in your head you are safe.</p><p><strong>Type III
    Fun</strong> is not fun, ever. It’s awful during the process and never redeeming
    after. Going to the DMV. Running through the twinge in your knee only to be in
    crutches for the next six months. Irreversible emotional damage from trauma. Avoid.</p><p>Type
    I fun is great. But to find a home at Tezza, you need to love type II fun. You
    want to push yourself, hard. You want to work, learn, and change extremely fast.
    You may even enjoy the feelings (fear, exhaustion, tears, sweat) that you associate
    with these goals. To you, nothing is more satisfying than coming out the other
    side, saying, “Holy crap, we survived! I can’t believe it! What’s next?”</p><p></p><h4>Are
    you a little weird?</h4><p>Normal people don’t like type II fun, and if you are
    a distinctly normal person, you probably aren’t going to like it here. We push
    boundaries: social, scientific, culinary, and more. Our moral compasses can create
    odd, occasionally fanatic behavior. We have drawers full of used plastic bags.
    We bike to work even though it’s dumping rain. We take trains for outrageously
    inconvenient distances. We relish breaking traditions or social norms to do the
    right thing or to do something well.</p><p>Our weirdness also comes across as
    a bit campy, less Rocky Horror Picture Show, more summer-campy/band-campy. We
    aren’t afraid to look like idiots, since we usually act like idiots because life
    is more fun that way. We are willing to ask awkward questions, share too much
    information, and build relationships quickly. We would rather play tag in the
    mud than wear suits in a conference room. We believe that a group of people with
    a goal and a safe space can change the world, and we can say that without rolling
    our eyes (that much).</p><p></p><h4>Do you consider money and power by-products?</h4><p>If
    money is your first priority, work in finance. If you want power above all, management
    consulting is a no-brainer. If you want to join a Silicon Valley startup with
    glossy offices, trendy swag, and fancy cars parked outside, there are many great
    options.</p><p>If you are here, be here because of the mission. Be here to work
    with other nerds excited about the same problems as you. Be here because you feel
    confident that everyone, bottom to top, wants to use dollars and power to fulfill
    the mission, not the pockets of nameless rich people. Unless things go to crap,
    everyone here will make plenty enough money, and we don’t abstain from things
    that bring us joy (savor every bite). But if you wear alligator leather shoes,
    Tezza is probably a bad fit.</p>'

  headline: The Process
  content: <p>Before you apply for any positions, first ask yourself big questions:</p><ul><li><p>In
    which moments have you felt the most fulfilled?* Why?</p></li><li><p>When you
    are dying and looking back on your life, what do you want to have felt, done,
    changed, created, or learned?</p></li></ul><p>*If you haven't had those moments,
    have you tried doing a bunch of random shit yet (i.e., not the same-same path
    that society shoves you into)?</p><p>If after thinking about those questions,
    you think that Tezza might be a good place for you to grow in the next stage of
    your life, take a look at our <a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/join/the-process"
