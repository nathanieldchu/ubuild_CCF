  headline: About us
  content: "<p>You can find our open positions below, but but before that it might
    be useful to ask yourself a few questions to see whether you are a good cultural
    fit.</p><h4>Do you love the steep end of the learning curve?</h4><p>What sounds
    like more fun:</p><p><strong>Being the expert</strong> in something and a company’s
    go-to resource for that thing. You crush it all day long.</p><p><strong>Constantly
    building</strong> by scheming up new ideas, getting totally lost, reading 100
    Wikipedia articles that you never would have guessed existed, figuring out how
    to turn your idea into reality, making a first version from scratch and duct tape,
    building another that totally kicks ass and shoving it out into the world, and
    then repeating all of it.</p><p>If the second one sounds like your jam, then we
    might be a good fit. We put equal value on expertise and open-minded ignorance.
    We love learning new topics, building new systems, and making real stuff. We may
    reach a time when we need experts to focus on one thing. But right now we seek
    stubborn optimists who won’t stop until the dream in their head lands in their
    hands. Few things are as exciting to us as doing something scary and new. Speaking
    of scary:</p><p></p><h4>Do you love type II fun?</h4><p>In mountaineering, there
    are three types of fun:</p><p><strong>Type I Fun</strong>—also known as “fun”
    by normal people—is activities that are fun in the moment. Eating at your favorite
    restaurant. Seeing a surprise hit movie with your friends. Reading Harry Potter.
    Outdoor activities with great conditions (no bugs, deep powder) and mild objectives
    (alpine lake swimming, climbing hand cracks, fishing).</p><p><strong>Type II Fun</strong>
    sucks in the moment. It is painful, you are hungry and tired, and you were not
    prepared. You might die. Shit, are we going to die? But somehow you make it out,
    and in the rosy glow of hindsight you declare, “Wow, what a great experience!
    I learned so much about myself and the world! We did it!” Overzealous alpine objectives,
    your first breakup, having children. In its highest form, type II fun is when
    you feel in your heart like everything is going to implode (imposter syndrome,
    social rejection, pushing yourself past the limit), but you know in your head
    you are safe.</p><p><strong>Type III Fun</strong> is not fun, ever. It’s awful
    during the process and never redeeming after. Going to the DMV. Running through
    the twinge in your knee only to be in crutches for the next six months. Irreversible
    emotional damage from trauma. Avoid.</p><p>Type I fun is great. But to find a
    home at Tezza, you need to love type II fun. You want to push yourself. You may
    even enjoy the feelings (fear, intimidation, tears) that you associate with these
    goals. To you, nothing is more satisfying than coming out the other side, saying,
    “Holy crap, we survived! I can’t believe it! What’s next?”</p><p></p><h4>Are you
    a little weird?</h4><p>Normal people don’t like type II fun, and if you are a
    distinctly normal person, you probably aren’t going to like it here. We push boundaries:
    social, scientific, culinary, and more. Our moral compasses can create odd, occasionally
    fanatic behavior. We have drawers full of used plastic bags. We bike to work even
    though it’s dumping rain. We take trains for outrageously inconvenient distances.
    We relish breaking traditions or social norms to do the right thing or to do something
    well.</p><p>Our weirdness also comes across as a bit campy, less Rocky Horror
    Picture Show, more summer-campy/band-campy. We aren’t afraid to look like idiots,
    since we usually act like idiots because life is more fun that way. We are willing
    to ask awkward questions, share too much information, and build relationships
    quickly. We would rather play tag in the mud than wear suits in a conference room.
    We believe that a group of people with a goal and a safe space can change the
    world, and we can say that without rolling our eyes (that much).</p><p></p><h4>Do
    you consider money and power by-products?</h4><p>If money is your first priority,
    work in finance. If you want power above all, management consulting is a no-brainer.
    If you want to join a Silicon Valley startup with glossy offices, trendy swag,
    and fancy cars parked outside, there are many great options.</p><p>If you are
    here, be here because of the mission. Be here to work with other nerds excited
    about the same problems as you. Be here because you feel confident that everyone,
    bottom to top, wants to use dollars and power to fulfill the mission, not the
    pockets of nameless rich people. Unless things go to crap, everyone here will
    make plenty enough money, and we don’t abstain from things that bring us joy (savor
    every bite). But if you wear alligator leather shoes, Tezza is probably a bad
    fit.</p>"

  headline: The Process
  content: <p>Before you apply for any positions, first ask yourself big questions:</p><ul><li><p>In
    which moments have you felt the most fulfilled?* Why?</p></li><li><p>When you
    are dying and looking back on your life, what do you want to have felt, done,
    changed, created, or learned?</p></li></ul><p>*If you haven't had those moments,
    have you tried doing a bunch of random shit yet (i.e., not the same-same path
    that society shoves you into)?</p><p>If after thinking about those questions,
    you think that Tezza might be a good place for you to grow in the next stage of
    your life, take a look at our <a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/join/the-process"
