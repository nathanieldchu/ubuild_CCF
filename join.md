  headline: About us
  content: "<p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to excite people about eating sustainably
    by crafting cultured foods that tap into the diversity of the microbial world.
    Instead of handing out lectures or guilt trips, we want to create a world where
    food tastes fantastic, is affordable and accessible, and happens to be made from
    the most sustainable ingredients around.</p><p><strong>Our core values</strong>
    are:</p><p><strong>Give a shit</strong>. Care about what you do, care about how
    you do it, care about the people you do it with, and care about the planet and
    everything else that brought you here in the first place.</p><p><strong>Strive
    for better</strong>. To make a future world better than the present, make your
    present self better than your past. Challenge yourself to change. Invest in the
    person you want remembered. Don’t compare yourself with others, but with who you
    were yesterday.</p><p><strong>Empower others</strong>. Seek your success by helping
    others achieve theirs. On your deathbed, what will you remember: learning to ride
    a bike or teaching your kid to ride a bike? By helping others, you achieve missions
    greater than yourself and feel the joy of being proud instead of pompous.</p><p><strong>Treat
    feedback as a gift</strong>. Ideas, critiques, questions, and feelings are the
    most valuable things you will ever give or get. Give them thoughtfully, and receive
    them gratefully.</p><p><strong>Savor every bite</strong>. Have fun and take care
    of yourself. You have one life; bask in it.</p>"
