  headline: About us
  content: "<p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to excite people about eating sustainably
    by crafting cultured foods that tap into the diversity of the microbial world.
    Instead of handing out lectures or guilt trips, we want to create a world where
    food tastes fantastic, is affordable and accessible, and happens to be made from
    the most sustainable ingredients around.</p><p><strong>Our core values</strong>
    are:</p><p><strong>Give a shit</strong>. Care about what you do, care about how
    you do it, care about the people you do it with, and care about the planet and
    everything else that brought you here in the first place.</p><p><strong>Think
    on evolutionary timescales</strong>. Most bad things result from short-term thinking.
    Climate change, war, all-you-can-eat Indian buffet. But life is a long-term game,
    so be honest, be humble, and don’t be an asshole.</p><p><strong>Stay hungry</strong>.
    Seek discomfort and growth. To make a future world better than the present, make
    your present self better than your past. Don’t compare yourself with others but
    with who you were yesterday.</p><p><strong>Make meaning through others</strong>.
    Look, we all fantasize about abandoning the world for a hut in the woods. But
    in life, most meaningful things are experienced with others, and the biggest problems
    aren’t solved alone. Trust others, and they will trust you; understand others,
    and you will understand yourself; work with others on big problems, and wake up
    with a purpose.</p><p><strong>Savor every bite.</strong> Have fun and take care
    of yourself. Sometimes even the end of civilization isn’t that serious. You have
    one life; bask in it.</p>"

  content: "<p>You can't help others unless you have enough in the tank. You can't
    face your fears if you feel constantly insecure. We are always looking for ways
    to build a supportive community so that each member can take on challenges, demons,
    and missions with chutzpah. As part of this community, we work to provide security

    salaries, equity ownership, retirement plans, transparent and progressive pay
    structures</p></li><li><p><strong>Physical health</strong>: health insurance,
    active community, proximity to Berkeley Bowl produce</p></li><li><p><strong>Mental
    health</strong>: minimum 3 weeks paid time off with bullshit-free support for
    taking more when you need it</p></li><li><p><strong>Social health</strong>: parental
    leave, communal lunch not at your desk</p></li><li><p><strong>Spiritual health</strong>:
    regular meetings to exchange feedback and ensure that you are asking the hard
    questions and we are supporting you to pursue your truest self, dark chocolate</p></li></ul>"
