  headline: Summary
  content: <p>We’re looking for our first business operations and strategy hire to
    help us create a more sustainable food system. You are a jack of all trades, like
    to get things done in the scrappiest way possible, and enjoy the strategic, the
    tactical, and the stuff that just needs to get done. And most importantly, you
    share our <a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/values">values</a>. This position
    is based in Oakland, CA and offers competitive salary and equity.</p>

  headline: About Tezza
  content: <p>Tezza is an early-stage public benefit corporation focused on climate
    change and sustainability. Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery
    shelf, and table, the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. To achieve
    this, our mission is to craft cultured foods that tap into the diversity of the
    microbial world.</p><p>We are starting with a new category of aged, hard cheeses—that
    happen to be made from plants. The dairy industry produces more than <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/CA2929EN/ca2929en.pdf">3%</a>
    of global greenhouse gas emissions—more than aviation—and poses further sustainability
    as well as animal-welfare challenges. We provide better, more affordable, and
    healthier products that bring people together around a shared love of food.</p>

  content: <p>We build relationships thoughtfully, and this approach takes time. Over

    long term? And most importantly, why? Where did those motivations come from?</p></li><li><p>What
    are the most important things that you are striving to improve in yourself? What
    are you doing to work on them? And how would that work either amplify a superpower
    or cure an achilles heel?</p></li></ol><p>Tezza is an equal opportunity employer.
    We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin,
    gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status or disability

    We do our best and apologize and learn when that’s not enough.</p>
