  headline: The process
  content: <p><strong>Initial application. </strong>When creating your resume, <a
    href="https://careers.google.com/videos/google-resume-tips-and-advice/" title="">Google
    has pretty good advice</a> on how to build it. If you are a recent college or
    master's student, include your classes and grades. When responding to our written
    questions, please be specific and detailed (always include an answer to "why?").
    These answers are your chance to tell us about how we fit into the journey of
    your life.</p><p><strong>Introductory conversation.</strong> We will have an unstructured
    conversation with you to learn a bit about who you are, how you think, and how
    you execute. What is special about you, and how can we help you find the best
    place for your mind and heart? We will also have time for you to ask us questions.</p><p><a
    href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/join/skills-assessment" title=""><strong>Practical
    skills assessment</strong></a><strong>.</strong> For all positions, we will ask
    you guide us in a technical discussion about a project you have done or one that
    you propose. The goal is for both parties to learn how the other approaches problems
    and whether working together would be fun!</p><p><strong>More structured in-person
    or video-call conversations</strong>. Depending on the role, you will have more
    structured conversations around values, culture, and professional and personal
    growth.</p><p><strong>Reference checks.</strong> Honestly, nobody is really good
    at reading people, so we try to incorporate the wisdom of the crowd. We will contact
    people who have interacted with you in different contexts, including above, beside,
    and below you in a professional setting and from your personal life.</p><p><strong>You
    join the colony or we help you find your next adventure.</strong> Whatever the
    outcome, we want to enable you to achieve your mission. If you join us, we will
    challenge one another every day to make ourselves and the world better. If you
    don't join us, we will do the same thing but probably a lot less often. Throughout
    the hiring process and early days of our partnership, we will craft a structured
    plan for your growth with regular opportunities for feedback.</p>
