  headline: The process
  content: <p><strong>Initial application. </strong>When creating your resume, <a
    href="https://careers.google.com/videos/google-resume-tips-and-advice/" title="">Google
    has pretty good advice</a> on how to build it. If you are a recent college or
    master's student, include your classes and grades. When responding to our written
    questions, please be specific and detailed (always include an answer to "why?").
    These answers are your chance to tell us about how we fit into the journey of
    your life.</p><p><strong>Thirty-minute in-person or video-call conversation.</strong>
    We will have a structured 30-minute conversation with you to learn a bit about
    who you are, how you think, and how you execute. What is special about you, and
    how can we help you find the best place for your mind and heart? We will also
    have time for you to ask us questions.</p><p><strong>Practical skills assessment.</strong>
    For all positions, we will ask you to choose your own small project that reflects
    the position. It's meant to be a chance to explore your curiosity! These projects
    will usually task you to ask a question you find exciting, formulate a plan to
    seek answers, and execute that plan if practical. If the job is one in product
    development, we may ask you to document an experiment in the kitchen that you've
    been dying to do. Or if it is a science role, we may ask you to analyze a recent
    paper of your choice.</p><p><strong>More 30-minute in-person or video-call conversations</strong>.
    Depending on the role, you will have at least one more structured conversation
    with other team members.</p><p><strong>Reference checks.</strong> Honestly, nobody
    is really good at reading people, so we try to incorporate the wisdom of the crowd.
    We will contact people who have interacted with you in different contexts, including
    above, beside, and below you in a professional setting and others from your personal
    network.</p><p><strong>You join the colony, or we help you find your next adventure.</strong>
    Whatever the outcome, we want to enable you to achieve your mission. If you join
    us, we will challenge one another every day to make ourselves and the world better.
    If you don't join us, we will do the same thing but probably a lot less often.
    Throughout the hiring process and early days of our partnership, we will craft
    a structured plan for your growth with regular opportunities for feedback. If
    we find that the fit isn't right, we will support you fully in finding the right
    place for you to advance your mission.</p>
