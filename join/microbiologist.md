  headline: Summary
  content: <p>We’re looking for an experimental microbiologist to help us create a
    more sustainable food system. You want to apply your scientific expertise to a
    real product that you can taste and push forward the application of community
    ecology, systems thinking, and computational throughput to the narrowly focused
    field of microbial engineering. And most importantly, you share our <a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/values">values</a>.
    This position is based in Oakland, CA and offers competitive salary and equity.</p>

  headline: About Tezza
  content: <p>Tezza is an early-stage public benefit corporation focused on climate
    change and sustainability. Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery
    shelf, and table, the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. To achieve
    this, our mission is to craft cultured foods that tap into the diversity of the
    microbial world.</p><p>We are starting with a new category of aged, hard cheeses—that
    happen to be made from plants. The dairy industry produces more than <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/CA2929EN/ca2929en.pdf">3%</a>
    of global greenhouse gas emissions—more than aviation—and poses further sustainability
    as well as animal-welfare challenges. We provide better, more affordable, and
    healthier products that bring people together around a shared love of food.</p>

  headline: If interested, what should you do?
  content: <p>We build relationships thoughtfully, and this approach takes time. Over
    multiple conversations, we will seek to understand how we can support you, and

    a bunch of nutcases. You can learn about<a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/join">
    our values, hiring process, and benefits here</a>.</p><p>To apply, please email
    <strong>join@tezzafoods.com</strong> with a resume and responses to the following
    prompts (a conversational, unpolished tone is fine):</p><ol><li><p>What motivates
    you right now? When you think about your short life, what motivates you for the
    long term? And most importantly, why? Where did those motivations come from?</p></li><li><p>What
    are the most important things that you are striving to improve in yourself? What
    are you doing to work on them? And how would that work either amplify a superpower
    or cure an achilles heel?</p></li></ol><p>Tezza is an equal opportunity employer.

    gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status or disability
