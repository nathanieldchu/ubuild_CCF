  headline: About you
  content: "<p>You want to fight ecological destruction. You also want to be a part
    of the fast-paced, passion-driven world of startups. But you are looking for people
    who care about sustainability as more than window-dressing for private equity
    firms or shiny packaging for influencers.</p><p>For this position, you want to
    tell stories through a brand that tries to make the world a better place without
    being a pedantic ass. You are bold, experimental, and human, while creating the
    very first seeds and roots of a food brand with big ambitions. You are a brand
    omnivore, excited to tackle all types of channels and strategies.</p>"

  headline: About us
  content: "<p>Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery shelf, and table,
    the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. Our mission is to excite
    people about eating sustainably by crafting cultured foods that tap into the diversity
    of the microbial world. We are starting with a new category of aged, hard cheeses—that
    happen to be made from plants. Founded by a nerd with fancy degrees from fancy
    places, we are taking the time to understand the science of cheesemaking and manipulating
    those processes to work with plants. We are a public benefit corporation, meaning
    that we are culturally and legally obligated to put our mission over money.</p>"

    different aspects of building an early-stage startup</p></li><li><p>We focus on
    growth, and we hire you not for this position, but for your next three positions.
    We will work with you to craft a learning plan to achieve your personal and career
    goals, at Tezza or elsewhere</p></li></ul>"

  headline: If excited about the job, what should you do?
  content: <p>We build relationships thoughtfully, and this approach takes time. Over
    multiple conversations, we will seek to understand how we can support you, and
    hopefully you will find out whether we are a good fit for your goals or simply
    a bunch of nutcases. You can learn about <a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/values"
    title="">our values here</a>.</p><p>You can read more about our <a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/join/the-process"
    title="">hiring process here</a>.</p><p>To apply, please email <strong>join@tezzafoods.com</strong>
    with a resume and responses to the following prompts (a conversational, unpolished
    tone is fine):</p><ol><li><p>What motivates you right now? When you think about
    your short life, what motivates you for the long term? And most important, why?
    Where did those motivations come from?</p></li><li><p>What are the most important
    things that you are striving to improve in yourself? What are you doing to work
    on them? And how would that work either amplify a superpower or cure an achilles
    heel?</p></li></ol><p>Tezza is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate
    on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation,
    age, marital status, veteran status or disability status. But we acknowledge that
    we are flawed humans within a flawed society. We do our best and apologize and
    learn when that’s not enough.</p>
