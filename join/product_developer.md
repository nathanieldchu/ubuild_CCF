  headline: About Tezza
  content: <p>Tezza is an early-stage public benefit corporation focused on climate
    change and sustainability. Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery
    shelf, and table, the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. To achieve
    this, our mission is to craft cultured foods that tap into the diversity of the
    microbial world.</p><p><br>We are starting with a new category of aged, hard cheeses—that
    happen to be made from plants. The dairy industry produces more than <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/CA2929EN/ca2929en.pdf">3%</a>
    of global greenhouse gas emissions—more than aviation—and poses further sustainability
    as well as animal-welfare challenges. We provide better, more affordable, and
    healthier products that bring people together around a shared love of food.</p>

  headline: About us
  content: "<p>Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery shelf, and table,
    the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. Our mission is to excite
    people about eating sustainably by crafting cultured foods that tap into the diversity
    of the microbial world. We are starting with a new category of aged, hard cheeses—that
    happen to be made from plants. Founded by a nerd with fancy degrees from fancy
    places, we are taking the time to understand the science of cheesemaking and manipulating
    those processes to work with plants. We are a public benefit corporation, meaning
    that we are culturally and legally obligated to put our mission over money.</p>"

    tone is fine):</p><ol><li><p>What motivates you right now? When you think about
    your short life, what motivates you for the long term? And most important, why?
    Where did those motivations come from?</p></li><li><p>What are the most important
    things that you are striving to improve in yourself? What are you doing to work
    on them? And how would that work either amplify a superpower or cure an achilles
    heel?</p></li></ol><p>Tezza is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate

    learn when that’s not enough.</p>
