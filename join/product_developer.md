    who care about sustainability as more than window-dressing for private equity
    firms or shiny packaging for influencers.</p><p>For this position, you prefer
    to get your hands dirty rather than stare at a computer screen. You love to tinker,
    make great food, work efficiently, maintain clear notes, and keep things orderly
    and clean. You have surprising physical endurance and can lift heavy stuff and
    work quickly for long work days.</p>"

  headline: About us
  content: "<p>Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery shelf, and table,
    the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. Our mission is to excite
    people about eating sustainably by crafting cultured foods that tap into the diversity
    of the microbial world. We are starting with a new category of aged, hard cheeses—that
    happen to be made from plants. Founded by a nerd with fancy degrees from fancy
    places, we are taking the time to understand the science of cheesemaking and manipulating
    those processes to work with plants. We are a public benefit corporation, meaning
    that we are culturally and legally obligated to put our mission over money.</p>"

    Where did those motivations come from?</p></li><li><p>What are the most important
