  headline: About Tezza
  content: <p>Tezza is an early-stage public benefit corporation focused on climate
    change and sustainability. Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery
    shelf, and table, the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. To achieve
    this, our mission is to craft cultured foods that tap into the diversity of the
    microbial world.</p><p><br>We are starting with a new category of aged, hard cheeses—that
    happen to be made from plants. The dairy industry produces more than <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/CA2929EN/ca2929en.pdf">3%</a>
    of global greenhouse gas emissions—more than aviation—and poses further sustainability
    as well as animal-welfare challenges. We provide better, more affordable, and
    healthier products that bring people together around a shared love of food.</p>

  content: <p>We build relationships thoughtfully, and this approach takes time. Over

    long term? And most importantly, why? Where did those motivations come from?</p></li><li><p>What
    are the most important things that you are striving to improve in yourself? What
    are you doing to work on them? And how would that work either amplify a superpower
