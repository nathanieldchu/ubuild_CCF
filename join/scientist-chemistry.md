  headline: About Tezza
  content: <p><a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/">Tezza</a> is an early-stage public
    benefit corporation focused on climate change and sustainability. Our vision is
    a world where on every menu, grocery shelf, and table, the most exciting foods
    are also the most sustainable. To achieve this, our mission is to use modern,
    high-throughput science to discover cultured foods that tap into the diversity
    of the microbial world.</p><p><br>We are starting with a new category of aged,
    hard cheeses—that happen to be made from plants. The dairy industry produces more
    than <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/CA2929EN/ca2929en.pdf">3%</a> of global greenhouse
    gas emissions—more than aviation—and poses further sustainability as well as animal-welfare
    challenges. We provide better, more affordable, and healthier products that bring
    people together around a shared love of food.</p>
