  headline: Science fit assessment
  content: "<p>The goal of this assessment is to provide a two-way window into how
    you and we think about science, solving problems, designing experiments, and communicating.
    Instead of standard talks—which won’t tell you much about us—we prefer to have
    informal conversations with groups of no more than three people. The intent is
    to provide a forum for active questions, discussions, and tangents. Please do
    not spend crazy amounts of time preparing for this assessment (i.e., more than
    a couple of hours) or feel compelled to do something immediately relevant or valuable
    to us. Do what sounds fun!</p><p>We ask you to prepare one of the following:</p><p><em>Project
    story</em></p><p>Please prepare a story of a scientific or technical project that
    you have done. Instead of a standard expositional talk (since we likely have already
    read your papers), we are most interested in the decision making that happened
    as your project unfolded. What is the story of your project? Who are the characters?
    What were their choices? What went wrong? Feel free to prepare any slides, drawings,
    whiteboards, etc. that you think will help tell your story.</p><p><em>Project
    proposal</em></p><p>Please prepare a brief open-ended project proposal on a scientific
    problem that you find interesting. It can be about anything, although we mildly
    suggest that you choose a topic that you feel you have some expertise in. Although
    basics will be helpful (a little background, problem statement, a few questions
    and ideas on how to answer them), this proposal should not be a fully fleshed
    out research grant, but a scaffold for conversation. Feel free to prepare any
    slides, drawings, whiteboards, etc. that you think will help guide us.</p>"
