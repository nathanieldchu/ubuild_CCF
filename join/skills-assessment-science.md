  headline: 'Chalktalk: project or proposal?'
  content: "<p>The goal with this assessment is to provide a two-way window into how
    you and we think about science, solving problems, designing experiments, and communicating.
    To avoid standard talks—which won’t teach you much about us—we prefer to have
    chalktalks with small groups of no more than 3 people, where the expectation is
    for active questions, discussions, and tangents. Please do not spend crazy amounts
    of time on this task (e.g., more than 3 hours) or feel compelled to do something
    immediately relevant or valuable to us. That’s called consulting; this is a conversation
    about fit. Do what sounds fun!</p><p>To provide a forum for this discussion, we
    ask you to prepare one of the following:</p><p><em>Project story</em></p><p>Please
    prepare a story of a scientific or technical project that you have done. Instead
    of a standard expositional talk (since we likely have already read your papers),
    we are interested in the decision making that happened as the project unfolded.
    One way to think about it is: if someone made a documentary about your project,
    what story would it tell? Who are the characters and what were their choices?
    What went wrong? Feel free to prepare any slides, drawings, whiteboards, etc.
    that you think will help convey your story.</p><p><em>Project proposal</em></p><p>Please
    prepare an open-ended project proposal on a scientific problem that you find interesting.
    It can be about anything, although we mildly suggest that you do something that
    you feel you have some expertise in. Although basics will be helpful (a little
    background, problem statement, a few questions and ideas on how to answer them),
    this proposal should not be a fully fleshed out research grant, but a scaffold
    for conversation. Feel free to prepare any slides, drawings, whiteboards, etc.
    that you think will help guide us.</p>"
